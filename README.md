# Augurk Public Website

This repository contains the source material from which we build our public website at https://augurk.github.io/.
We use Hugo, a static site generator, to build our public website from Markdown documents. This makes it a lot easier
to make changes to the website, without having to edit the raw HTML.

## Contributing

Contributions to our website to improve documentation (even if it's just a typo fix) are always welcome. Please refer
to our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
