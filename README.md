# Augurk Public Website

This repository contains the source material from which we build our public website at https://augurk.github.io/.
We use Hugo, a static site generator, to build our public website from Markdown documents. This makes it a lot easier
to make changes to the website, without having to edit the raw HTML.

## Contributing

Contributions to our website to improve documentation (even if it's just a typo fix) are always welcome. Please refer
to our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Images

The website includes a couple of mockup images of Augurk. These have been generated using the templates listed below and then cropping them so they fit to the page. Since we might need to replace the screenshots of Augurk in the future we've kept a list of the templates being used:
